# inventory-application

## Description

This project's goal is to build an Inventory Management App for an imaginary store. The app will have items and categories that users will be able to view.
The user should also be able to create new items and categories. Authenticated users should have rights to update and delete items/categories using a password.

The database storing items and categories will be stored with PostgreSQL.
